In this section we have provided experiment analysis. In the experiment we have focused on (1) correctness of our proposed algorithm and (2) the comparison with existing algorithms. For the extensive experiment we have choose mushroom dataset ~\cite{dataset} and T40I10D100K database. The reason we have choose these two dataset is, mushroom ~\cite{dataset} is real life dataset and dense dataset whereas T40I10D100K ~\cite{dataset} is synthetic and spase dataset generated by a generator from the IBM Almaden Quest. Table \ref{table:dataset} shows the details the properties for dataset ~\cite{dataset}. The experimental reslusts have been given below.
	\subsection{Algorithm Performance Analysis}
	From our experiment we have got that our algorithm works effeciently with any number of batch size, window size, the false positive found in the

	\subsubsection{Memory Comparison}
	As our proposed \emph{US-tree} have capability to share nodes more than \emph{SUF-grouwth} ~\cite{dataset}, we get much more gain in memory. The experimental result also indicates that very clearly. Figure \ref{result:g_m_memory_node} shows the memory comparison on mushroom dataset. Mushroom is dense database so we get  much more gain in memory. The graph clearly shows that with the increase of total transaction in the tree gives the much more gain. Dense dataset have more scope to share nodes more. Figure \ref{result:g_t10_memory_node} also shows that in T40I10D100K database we also gain the memory optimization. As the database is sparse, we get the memory gain less then dense one.
