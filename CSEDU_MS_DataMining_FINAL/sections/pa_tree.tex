\emph{U\textsuperscript{cap}}  

In this section we will describe about our tree construction \emph{US-tree}. We have describe earlier about our batch and window. A batch should be inserted into the tree in it's own window slot. After inserting all batches of to full the window, the window shall be complete and be ready to mine. We said earlier section that our tree will be very compact. For this we have proposed an approach for sharing nodes. For sharing same tree nodes two items with same id and order should not care about own existential probability. If item is already in the tree with same id then two items should share the node. Thus the tree will be very compact.When inserting an item in the tree the \emph{U\textsuperscript{cap}}  of the tree should be updated by adding the prefix value of the node. Thus each batch should be inserted into the tree. FOR EXAMPLE TABLE REF. We
