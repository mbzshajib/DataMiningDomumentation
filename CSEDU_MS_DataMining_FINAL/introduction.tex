\section{Our Contribution}
Our key contributions are given below
\begin{itemize}
\item We have introduced an prefix value for each items in a transaction which always maintain upper bound of probability. That helps us to make compact pattern tree construction.
\item A new approach \emph{US-tree} that is very much compact and very memory effecient
\item A new mining algorithm \emph{USFP-growth} that is very efficient and reduce mining time surprisingly.
\item 
\end{itemize}
\section{Thesis Organization}
We have carried out the thesis work to consummate the objectives. An outline of rest of the chapters is provided as follows:
\paragraph{Chapter 2}
Describes the necessary background study and existing approaches.
\paragraph{Chapter 3}
Provides the details of our proposed approach with required analysis.
\paragraph{Chapter 4}
Presents the results of experimental results in detail with comparison and analysis.
\paragraph{Chapter 5}
Shows several real life applications for our proposed approach and ends the thesis with a brief conclusion and future scopes.
